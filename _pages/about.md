<!-- I am an Aerospace Engineer with interest in Flight Dynamics, Flight Vehicle Guidance - Navigation & Control, Nonlinear State Estimation & Filtering, Algorithm Design and Machine Learning.

<div style="text-align: justify;">
I am an aerospace engineer and researcher with a strong interest in flight dynamics, flight vehicle guidance nagivation and control, nonlinear state estimation and filtering, robust; optimal; linear/nonlinear; intelligent and adaptive control, optimization, and machine learning, particularly as applied to autonomous and aerospace systems. My work sits at the intersection of theory and implementation, where mathematical modeling meets simulation and real-world constraints.

</div>


<div style="text-align: justify;">
I am especially interested in problems involving dynamic systems, trajectory optimization, adaptive control, and learning-based decision making. Much of my recent work focuses on topics such as powered landing of reusable launch vehicles, convex optimization–based trajectory planning, and reinforcement learning approaches inspired by AlphaZero-style self-play algorithms.

<div style="text-align: justify;">
I enjoy building things from first principles—deriving models, implementing algorithms from scratch, and validating ideas through simulation. I have hands-on experience with MATLAB/Simulink, Python, c++, and numerical optimization tools, and I am comfortable working with state-space modeling, LQR/MPC/H-infinity/PID/sliding mode/neural network, MRAC adaptive control, and estimation techniques.

</div>


<div style="text-align: justify;">
Furthermore, I am motivated by curiosity and a desire to deeply understand how complex systems behave and how we can control them reliably under uncertainty. I aim to pursue further research in control, robotics, machine learnring and aerospace engineering, where I can contribute to the development of safe, efficient, and intelligent autonomous systems.

<div style="text-align: justify;">
Beyond this, I like to play Counter Strike 2, Connect 4, Connect 5 and 8 Ball Pool Trickshots. In my free time, I watch anime and listen to music.
